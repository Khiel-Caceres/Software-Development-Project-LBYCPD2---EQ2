# VerifyMySymptoms (VMS): COVID-19 Monitor
Project for LBYCPD2 (EQ2)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**INTRODUCTION**

One of the problems people experience during this pandemic is determining if they have symptoms for 
COVID-19 or not. This project is a program that mainly checks whether the user has mild, moderate or 
severe COVID-19 symptoms. Due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in our country, the pandemic
might not end anytime soon. Hence, the project is made for verifying a user's symptom/s and telling 
them about its severity. The program's scope is limited to the different COVID-19 symptoms only. 
Furthermore, its main purpose is to raise awareness about COVID-19 symptoms. Besides the project's 
relevance nowadays, it will benefit all the users because of the following: (1) they will be aware or 
more aware about COVID-19 symptoms, (2) they can differentiate if a COVID-19 symptom is mild, moderate 
or severe, and (3) they know what to do after determining a symptom's severity such as seeking help 
immediately or needing to do self-quarantine. This project is intended for clients who are curious 
and cautious. Specifically, they would want to check if what they are feeling is problematic or not,
so they would know if they should feel at ease or seek help immediately. People would appreciate this
due to its accessibility especially now that going to a hospital is risky, and it is also difficult 
to make an appointment for a checkup.
